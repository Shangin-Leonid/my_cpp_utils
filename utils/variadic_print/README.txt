VARIADIC_PRINT

The "void variadic_print(char sep_symb, ...)" function allows us to print arbitrary amount of
variables or objects of any different types having 
"std::ostream & operator<<(std::ostream & os, T obj)" overloading.

The function also gets the "char sep_symb" which appears between variables' outputing.
